# Sports-budget-allocation-using-ML
It seems like you are trying to create a simple linear regression model for predicting budget allocation for sports based on the years. Your code uses the Gradio library to create a user interface for predicting the budget for a future year. If you are looking to create a README file for your Git repository, you can include information about the purpose of your project, how to set it up, and any other relevant details.

Here's a basic template for your README file:

# Budget Allocation Prediction for Sports

This project aims to predict the budget allocation for sports based on historical data using a linear regression model. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about the budget allocation and corresponding years.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Gradio

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the following script to launch the Gradio interface for predicting the budget for a future year:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL to interact with the prediction interface.

## Dataset

The dataset (`budget_allocation_for_sports.csv`) contains information about budget allocation and corresponding years. It is used to train the linear regression model.

## Model Details

The linear regression model is trained on the numerical years to predict the budget allocation for sports.
