# Sports Budget Allocation Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the budget allocation for sports based on historical data. The predictive model utilizes linear regression and is deployed through a Gradio interface, allowing users to forecast the budget for a future year.

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting sports budget allocations based on historical data, utilizing three different regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The predictive models are trained on a dataset containing information about budget allocations and corresponding years. Additionally, a Gradio interface has been integrated to facilitate user-friendly predictions for future budget allocations.

## Advantages

1. **Predictive Accuracy:** The project employs three different regression models to provide accurate predictions of sports budget allocations.

2. **Flexibility:** By incorporating multiple regression models, the project allows for flexibility in choosing the most suitable model for the task.

3. **User Interface:** The integration of Gradio provides an interactive and intuitive interface for users to predict sports budget allocations for a given future year.

## Process

### Data Preparation

- The dataset (`budget_allocation_for_sports.csv`) is loaded and cleaned, converting the budget allocation column to numeric values.

- The numerical year is extracted from the 'Years' column to enhance the model's understanding of the temporal aspect.

### Linear Regression Model

- A Linear Regression model is trained on the dataset to establish a baseline for predicting budget allocations.

- The model's accuracy is evaluated using mean squared error.

### Decision Tree Model

- A Decision Tree Regression model is trained to capture non-linear relationships within the data.

- The model's accuracy is assessed using mean squared error.

### Random Forest Model

- A Random Forest Regression model is employed for enhanced predictive performance through an ensemble of decision trees.

- The model's accuracy is measured using mean squared error.

## Why Prefer Linear Regression Model?

### Linear Regression Advantages

Linear Regression is chosen as the baseline model for the following reasons:

1. **Interpretability:** Linear Regression provides clear interpretability, allowing stakeholders to understand the relationship between the numerical year and budget allocation in a straightforward manner.

2. **Simplicity:** Linear Regression is a simple and easy-to-understand model, making it suitable for initial predictions and as a reference point for more complex models.

3. **Linearity:** The assumption of a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable aligns with the nature of budget allocation trends, making it a reasonable choice.

4. **Training Speed:** Linear Regression typically trains faster compared to more complex models like Decision Trees or Random Forests, contributing to efficient model development.

While Linear Regression serves as the initial model, the project offers the flexibility to explore more complex models for improved predictive performance based on specific requirements.

### Linear Regression Model Accuracy

- A Linear Regression model is trained on the dataset, and its accuracy is evaluated using mean squared error.

- The model's accuracy serves as a reference point for comparing the performance of more complex models in the project.

### Gradio Interface Integration

- Gradio is utilized to create an interactive user interface, allowing users to input a future year and receive predictions for the corresponding sports budget allocation.

- The Linear Regression model is used within the Gradio interface for budget predictions.

### Additional Installations
